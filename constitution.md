# Queer Code Scotland: Constitution

## Name

The name of the organisation is Queer Code Scotland.

## Purpose

To create an inclusive and welcoming space for LGBTQ+ technologists by organising meetups in 
Scotland.

## Code of conduct

Our meetups are open to anyone who would like to join. We expect all attendees to adhere to the 
following code of conduct. https://queer-code.org/coc

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to stop immediately. If a community member 
engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organisers may take any action they deem 
appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without 
warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## Membership

A member is deemed as someone who is a member of our meetup group. 
Membership is open for people to join and leave at any time. https://www.meetup.com/qcscot/members/

## Subscriptions

There is no cost of membership. On occasion we may decide to charge an 
entry fee if we have to incur costs in order to put on an event, but we will endeavour to avoid 
this wherever possible. 

## Committee

The committee exists primarily for the management of our finances. Other day to day activities are
organised by the volunteers on the #organisation-scotland Slack channel on the Queer Code Slack. 
See https://queer-code.org for details on how to join this Slack.

The committee will be formed of a minimum of two people: a chairperson and treasurer. 
Additional committee members may be appointed as required.

Appointment to the committee will be by agreement of the existing committee members.

Any committee member may step down from their position by informing the remainder of the committee.

In the event of misconduct of a committee member, the committee may require a committee member to 
leave the committee. This decision must be reached by a majority of committee members.

## Finances

Any authorised signatories on our bank accounts must be committee members. 
If a signatory ceases to be a member of the committee, then they must be removed as a signatory as 
soon as practicably possible.

Any one individual who is an authorised signatory on our bank accounts may enter into transactions 
provided that it is for one of the following reasons:
1. Putting on events 
    - e.g. purchase of food, drink or equipment to use at a meetup.
2. Making our events easier for people to access 
    - e.g. if someone cannot afford to travel to a meetup, we may decide to offer to help them with 
    their travel fare.

Signatories are not authorised to spend more money than we have in our accounts, nor are they 
authorised to apply for credit facilities on behalf of the organisation.

## Dissolution

If Queer Code Scotland were ever to be disbanded, any assets must be donated to an
organisation which helps LGBTQ+ people.

## Alteration of this document

It is expected that this document will be adapted over time, as our organisation evolves.
This constitution can be modified with approval from at least one committee member. The approver 
must not be the same person as the one who is proposing the change.
